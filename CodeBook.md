### Variables in tidy data

subject: this variable is an integer, from 1-30, representing the human subject.

activity: this variable is a factor from 1-6 which identifies the activity the human subject was performing at the time. The levels 1-6 represent the following activities in order: WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Tidy data also has the following 66 variables:

tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
tBodyAcc-std()-X
tBodyAcc-std()-Y
tBodyAcc-std()-Z

fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()
fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()
fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()

These variables are all numeric between -1 to 1 and represent the average value for each subject by activity type.

### Data transformation

The values in tidy data were obtained by joining the test and train data sets, and then calculating the mean of each variable grouped by subject and activity type.
